Considering the lack of documentation and code support for Xbee S6B, this would be a good template for general usage.
Using Xbee wifi modules to communicate to a computer using python, also to gather and use the data in general. 
The code included with this project is tested on Xbee S6B, but should work on most raw feed wifi hardware, including other wifi Xbee models. 

Hardware:
In this test, the Xbee S6B is connected to the (Rx,Tx) serial of a Arduino. The Xbee transmits user defined data printed to the serial, this data is read by a client connecting to the Xbee, using the code included. The Xbee is configured in SoftAp mode.The IP address, socket,ssid and other parameters of the Xbee may be changed by using the XCTU software.
